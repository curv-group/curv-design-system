# Building UI in a Curv OS

Consistency across our OS apps is **structural**, not something anyone re-decides
per screen. Before you write UI, you adopt the shared parts and the shared rules.
Skipping this is how apps drift apart — and how UI ends up merely "fine."

## Taste — the thing that actually separates good from fine

Taste is **trained, not innate**: the ability to see beyond "it works" to what
makes an interface feel right. You build it by studying great work, asking *why*
it feels good, and applying that relentlessly.

- **Unseen details compound.** Most of what makes UI feel premium is never
  consciously noticed — correct easing, concentric corners, optical alignment, a
  press that scales `0.97`. Individually invisible; in aggregate, unmistakable.
- **Beauty is leverage.** People choose tools on the *whole* experience, not the
  feature list. A crisp, considered interface is a real advantage — spend effort
  there.
- **Restraint is the default.** In a dense, power-user product, the tasteful move
  is usually *fewer* parts, not more. When unsure whether to add something,
  don't. When unsure whether to animate, don't.
- **Study the references before you build — every time.** The teams with the best
  taste have already solved most of this; don't reinvent it from a blank page.
  Before designing any component or flow, look at how they do it and ask *why* it
  feels good and *what pattern* makes it work — then borrow the reasoning, not the
  skin:
  - **Linear** — filtering, command menus, keyboard-first density, smooth
    micro-interactions. (Our filter UX is modelled on Linear's for a reason.)
  - **Vercel / Geist** — restraint, typography, spacing, elevation.
  - **Shopify Polaris** — dense admin surfaces, tables, data-heavy layouts.
  - **Apple HIG** — concentric corners, motion, optical detail.
  Then open the closest already-approved Curv screen (the showcase or the
  strongest revenue-os page) and match its structure, density, and rhythm. New UI
  should read as the same hand, not a new dialect.

## The bar — perfection is the spec

The standard is the Rams / Ive / Jobs standard: **"less, but better," carried
out until nothing feels arbitrary.** This is the acceptance criterion, not a
mood (the full doctrine is in `design-system.md` → *The bar*):

- **"Good enough" is a defect.** If a spacing, corner, alignment, or timing
  looks slightly off, it *is* off — fix it, never rationalize it.
- **Inconsistency is a bug, not a nitpick.** Two implementations of one pattern
  means one is wrong; treat it with the seriousness of a crash.
- **Paint the back of the fence.** Empty states, focus rings, disabled states,
  dark mode, reduced motion — the states nobody inspects must be as considered
  as the happy path, or the whole stops feeling inevitable.
- **Design is how it works.** Interaction correctness (focus, keyboard, no
  jitter) is held to the same bar as the pixels.
- **Review like a critic, not an author** — both themes, 100% zoom,
  keyboard-only, reduced-motion on. If it reads as a different hand, it goes
  back. Nothing ships at 90%.

Everything below is that taste written down as specific, checkable rules.

## The order of operations (do not skip step 1)

*First time wiring the design system into this OS? Do the one-time setup in
`docs/consuming-in-an-os.md` FIRST — theme import, Tailwind scan, the ESLint
config, the `AppFrame` shell. A missed step there is why an OS renders unstyled,
off-colour, or with a hand-rolled `bg-neutral-100` shell.*

0. **If this task is a redesign/rebuild of a page (not a tweak), run the
   `redesign-brief` skill FIRST.** Decide what the page is *for* — whose job it
   serves, what decisions it drives, what earns a place — *before* you touch
   layout. This skill is HOW it looks; `redesign-brief` is WHAT belongs there. A
   beautiful page of the wrong things is still the wrong page. (Skip straight to
   step 1 for a copy fix, a single-component swap, or a bug.)
1. **Read `docs/design-system.md` first.** It is the source of truth. Most UI
   mistakes are "wrote it before reading it." If the repo consumes
   `@curvgroup/design-system`, read that package's `docs/design-system.md`.
   **Execute this concretely**: grep the doc for every pattern you're about to
   touch (`Dropdown`, `tabs`, `toolbar`, `table`, `pill`, …) and read those
   sections in full — **the recipes live in the doc, not in this skill**, and
   "I read the skills" does not satisfy this step. (Case study: Batch 3's menu
   demo shipped a gray `secondary` trigger because this step was skipped — the
   outline-trigger recipe was sitting in the doc the whole time.)
2. **Reach for a shared component before hand-rolling.** The package exports a
   large, current set — the **showcase site is the live catalogue** and
   `docs/design-system.md` → *Components to reuse* is the full index. Grouped:
   - **Shell / layout:** `AppFrame` (the whole dark cradle + sticky bar + sidebar
     — never rebuild it), `TopBar`, `Sidebar`/`SidebarSection`/`SidebarItem`,
     `PageContainer` (`bleed`=full width), `PageHeader` (eyebrow + title + badge +
     an `actions` slot — it hosts controls, doesn't hardcode them), `Card`.
   - **Navigation:** `Tabs` (view-navigation — switching between distinct
     *views/sections* of a page, e.g. Overview / Inventory / Sales; **always the
     full-width bar at the very top of the content, under the app bar** — the
     page/entity header sits *below* it, inner width per tab follows its level,
     see design-system.md → *Page tabs*. A table's **status/row filter is NOT a
     page tab** — it stays in the table toolbar via the `DataTable` `tabs` prop),
     `SegmentedControl` (filter toggle *within* a view), `CommandPalette` (⌘K).
   - **Forms:** `Button` (has `loading`), `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`,
     `MultiSelect`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`/`RadioGroup`, `Switch`, `Field`,
     `DateRangePicker`.
   - **Data display:** `DataTable` (+ filter bar, `TableLink`/`getRowHref` for
     real row links, CSV/PDF export, sticky columns, loading skeleton,
     customize/saved views, bounded or virtualized rendering, and family
     hierarchy). Any interactive table — search, filter, sort, export, select,
     customize, or views — uses this package component. Native `<table>` is only
     for bounded read-only detail; matrices/calculators/permission grids stay
     specialized. Never create a local `DataTable` / `StandardTable` or copy the
     package implementation. **Column
     widths follow the Linear model:** leave exactly ONE primary text column with
     no `width`/`maxWidth` (the filler — it stretches to fill and truncates down
     to `minWidth` when narrow), give every other column a fixed `width`, and
     render truncating text cells as inline/string content (a `<span>` Fragment,
     not a wrapping `<div>`) so `…` shows. Never hand-roll a table or the export
     button — use `DataTable` + `exportFilename`. (Full rules: `docs/cheatsheet.md`
     → *DataTable column widths*.) The
     **reporting engine** — `StatCard`/`StatGroup`, `Sparkline`, `LineChart`,
     `BarChart`, `BarBreakdown`, `ChartCard` (the shell that hosts chart
     controls; chart stays a dumb primitive), `ReportTable` (P&L/matrix grid),
     `SummaryStrip` (the full-width breakdown above a list — total + horizontal
     stats + proportional bar; never a corner card) —
     plus `KanbanBoard`/`KanbanColumn`/`KanbanCard`, `HScroll`, `Badge`,
     `Avatar`/`AvatarGroup`, `CopyButton`.
   - **Overlays & feedback:** `Tooltip`, `Menu`, `Dialog`, `ConfirmDialog`
     (the sanctioned gate for destructive actions), `Drawer` (right-side sheet),
     `Popover`, `ToastProvider` + `toast` (with an `action`/Undo), `Banner`
     (rare, page-level), `EmptyState`, `Skeleton`, `Kbd`. These carry the
     interaction layer (focus trap/restore, keyboard, ARIA, positioning) via
     base-ui — **never re-implement overlay behavior by hand**, never use the
     native `title` attribute or `<select>`.
   - `cn` — class merging.
   Charts cap the y-axis at **≤5 nice-number gridlines**; the chart is a dumb
   primitive and controls (metric dropdown, compare, period) compose *around* it
   via `ChartCard` + `Select`/`SegmentedControl`/`DateRangePicker`. **A chart-sized
   surface must be interactive** (hover → values) — if a trend only needs its
   shape at a glance, use a `Sparkline` at sparkline size beside the number, never
   a full static chart frame that can't be hovered.
   If a shared component *almost* fits, **improve the shared component** — don't
   fork a private copy. **If the system genuinely has nothing that fits, you may
   build a new component — but it joins the language, it doesn't start a dialect:**
   built from the tokens, the `h-9` rhythm, concentric radius, `shadow-card`, and
   the taste rules, so a stranger can't tell it wasn't in the package. Treat it as
   a chance to *simplify* — cut clutter, drop what doesn't drive a decision, make
   it easier for the user, not just fill the gap. If the pattern recurs, promote it
   into the design system (design-system.md → *Components to reuse*).
3. **Import the theme, never raw colours.** Style through tokens (`bg-card`,
   `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, the `verdict-*` / `chart-*`
   families), never hex.
4. **Run `npm run lint` and fix every error** — a red lint is a blocker.
5. **Ask the design-review agent to review the diff** for the taste-level things
   lint can't see (`agents/design-review.md`). This step is **not optional** and
   it applies to **showcase demos too** — a demo teaches its pattern to every
   consumer, so a demo that deviates from a doc recipe propagates the deviation.
   Verifying that something *works* (opens, clicks, keyboard) is not this step;
   this step checks that it *conforms*.

## Mechanical rules (lint enforces these)

- **No full uppercase.** No `uppercase`, no `tracking-wider`/`tracking-widest`.
  Labels are **sentence case** ("Gap to goal", not "GAP TO GOAL").
- **No raw hex in className.** Use tokens. (The single sanctioned exception is
  the top-bar chrome `bg-[#1b1b1b]`, which `AppFrame`/`TopBar` already own.)

## Radius — concentric, not fixed (a taste rule, review-enforced)

When a rounded element sits inside another with padding between them:

    outer radius = inner radius + padding

so the corners run parallel instead of one looking pinched inside the other.
Mismatched nested radii are one of the most common things that make UI feel off.

**Proportional to size + elevation** (as Apple/Vercel reason): bigger, more-raised
→ rounder; small + dense → crisp.

- Chips / small dense cards (kanban & list items): `rounded-md` (~8–10px), kept
  tight like Linear's board cards.
- Buttons / inputs / toolbar controls: `rounded-md` (~8–10px).
- Content cards / panels / tables: `rounded-lg` (12px) — **the anchor** (matches
  Polaris cards + Geist medium/menu/modal; between Linear's 8px and iOS's 16px).
- Large floating surfaces (modals, boards, hero): `rounded-xl` (~16px).
- **Derive nested corners:** a `rounded-lg` (12px) child in a card with `p-2`
  (8px) → the card is `rounded-[20px]` (12 + 8). A child is **never** rounder
  than its parent. Above ~24px padding, treat layers as separate and pick each
  on its own.

(This replaced the old blunt "always `rounded-lg`, never `rounded-xl`" lint rule.
Concentricity can't be linted, so review owns it.)

## Polish details (the unseen correctness)

- **Fixed control heights — never padding-derived.** Every control in a
  toolbar/filter row gets an *explicit* height so the row aligns by rule, not by
  luck. The main toolbar height is **`h-9` (36px)** — search inputs, filter
  buttons, triggers, primary buttons all sit at `h-9`. A control whose height
  comes from `py-*` + text is the classic source of 1–2px misalignment; set the
  height, put padding inside it. (Dense in-table controls may drop to h-7/h-8.)
- **Numbers get `tabular-nums`** wherever digits align in columns or update in
  place (KPIs, tables, counters) so they don't jitter.
- **Optical alignment over geometric.** Icon + text buttons: the icon side gets
  ~2px less padding (`pl-4 pr-3.5`). Triangular/asymmetric glyphs (play, carets)
  shift ~1–2px toward their visual centre — fix it in the SVG when you can.
- **Elevation via shadow, not border.** Raised cards/containers use `shadow-card`
  (a hairline-as-shadow + soft drops), which adapts to any background. **But**
  dividers and layout separators (`border-t`, table cell lines, input outlines)
  stay real borders — the shadow rule is for *depth*, not separation.
- **Covering surfaces are full-bleed — verify box == region, at the edges.** Any
  element whose job is to **mask / back / overlay** a region (a sticky column's
  opaque cell, a header or toolbar background, a modal scrim, an edge-fade) must
  span the *entire* region it covers. Confirm its computed box equals the region
  on all four edges — never spot-check the centre (a too-short mask still hits
  the middle, giving a false pass; content behind then peeks at the uncovered
  edge). Two traps that caused real bugs here: grid `items-center` sizes a cell
  to its *content* height, not the row height, so a masking cell ends up shorter
  than its row (`self-stretch` to fill it); and fixed grid tracks can overflow a
  `min-width` container, so a header background stops before the last column
  (`min-w-max` so it spans every track). When you verify a cover, probe its
  corners.
- **`text-wrap: balance`** on headings, **`pretty`** on body — no orphans, no
  lonely last words.
- **Minimum hit area** ~40×40px on desktop controls (44 for touch); extend a
  small visible control's target with an `::after` pseudo-element rather than
  padding that distorts layout.
- **Image outlines** are a neutral `outline-black/10` (light) / `outline-white/10`
  (dark) with `-outline-offset-1` — never a tinted `zinc/slate` scale, which
  reads as dirt on the edge.
- **Squares use `size-*`** (`size-9`, not `h-9 w-9`) so width and height can never
  drift apart.
- **Full-height is `h-dvh`, not `h-screen`** — the dynamic viewport unit accounts
  for mobile browser chrome. Pad fixed / bottom-anchored elements with
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)` so they clear the notch and home indicator.
- **One z-index scale.** Layer through a small fixed set (dropdown → sticky →
  overlay → modal → toast), never ad-hoc `z-[9999]`.
- **Enable font smoothing** on the app body (`-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`).

## Accessibility (baseline, always — never a follow-up)

- Every control has an **accessible name**: icon-only buttons get `aria-label`;
  form fields get associated `<label>`s.
- **Keyboard-reachable with a visible focus ring.** Don't remove `:focus-visible`;
  don't build click-only controls.
- **Dialogs/menus** trap focus while open and restore it to the trigger on close.
- **Native semantics first** — a real `<button>`/`<a>`/`<input>` over a `div`
  with ARIA bolted on.
- **Form errors** are programmatically tied (`aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid`),
  not colour-only.
- **Destructive / irreversible actions confirm** — a delete goes through a confirm
  dialog (an alert dialog), never a bare one-click button.
- **Never block paste.** Don't disable paste on inputs (emails, codes, passwords);
  it breaks password managers and is user-hostile.
- Respect **`prefers-reduced-motion`** (see motion-system): keep opacity/colour,
  drop movement — reduced, not zero.

## Distill — subtract before you ship

The tasteful default is *less*. Before a screen is done, run a subtraction pass —
remove until it breaks, then add the one thing back:

> **Subtract noise, not signal.** The subtraction pass removes what drives no
> decision — never information the user came for. Don't trade a purpose-built,
> information-rich element (a value-by-status breakdown, a distribution) for a
> generic one to satisfy consistency; rebuild it with the reporting primitives
> instead. Consistency serves the page's job; it doesn't outrank it.

- **Halve the copy.** Cut labels and helper text to the shortest that still reads.
  A control that says what it does needs no paragraph under it.
- **Flatten nesting. Never nest a card in a card.** Related stats are **sections of
  one card** (`border-t` / `divide-x`), not a field of boxes. A third nesting level
  is a smell — stop.
- **Cut variants.** Every option is a decision every consumer must make and every
  future change must carry. Ship the one right default, not five.
- **One accent per view.** Semantic colour (verdict green/amber/red) is separate
  and doesn't count. If two things compete for "look here", one loses.
- **Remove decorative chrome.** Drop borders/shadows/dividers that aren't doing a
  job — if `shadow-card` already conveys the surface, the border is noise.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Hide advanced or rare controls behind a menu or a
  reveal; the common path stays clean.
- **One control row.** Filters/toolbar controls share one height (`h-9`) and one
  shape (`rounded-md border border-border bg-card`); Export sits rightmost.

When unsure whether something earns its place, remove it and see if anyone misses it.

## Motion

Defer to the **`motion-system`** skill for anything animated — the decision
framework (should it animate at all?), easing curves, sub-300ms durations,
`scale(0.97)` press feedback, origin-aware popovers, springs, and reduced-motion.
